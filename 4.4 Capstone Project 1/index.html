<h2> Summary</h2>
<h4> A curious and creative junior doctor with experience in hospitality, healthcare, and recruitment. I completed secondary school in the UK & applied to study medicine. Throughout my time at medical school, I took on volunteering projects including mentoring other students and represented my peers at the cohort and faculty level. I have been involved with youth work including GCSE schooling and camp counselling. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic I volunteered to work as a care assistant and band vaccinator. On completion of medical school, I progressed onto foundation training under the National Health Service. At present, I am hoping to broaden my skill set as part of my enjoyment of lifelong learning. I have an interest in public health and hope to gain some exposure on data science roles to expand my scope of work. Other facets that I am currently exploring include the wider world of tech, psychiatry, and education.  </h4>
